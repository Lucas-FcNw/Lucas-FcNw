## üåç About Me

Hey! I'm **Lucas Fernandes**, a Computer Science student who believes that technology becomes meaningful when it connects people, solves real problems, and creates opportunities to grow.  

I‚Äôm currently pursuing my **bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science**, exploring how data, infrastructure, and software architecture come together to build scalable, reliable systems.  
Even without a current internship, I keep learning by building, breaking, and rebuilding ‚Äî because the best lessons come from doing things hands-on.

## ‚ö° What Drives Me

- üìä Turning **data** into knowledge and smarter decisions  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Designing and maintaining **infrastructure** that scales  
- üß† Building efficient **back-end systems** that make everything run smoothly  

What excites me most is understanding how different technologies connect and how a small improvement can create a massive ripple effect.
